# Alternative: Simple budget alert setup
# You can also set this up manually in Google Cloud Console:
# 1. Go to Billing > Budgets & Alerts
# 2. Create a new budget
# 3. Set amount to $50/month
# 4. Add alerts at 50%, 80%, 100%, and 120%
# 5. Configure email notifications

# Recommended budget breakdown:
# - Cloud Functions: $30/month (estimated)
# - Firestore: $15/month (estimated)
# - FCM: $5/month (estimated)
# - Total: $50/month

# Cost optimization tips:
# 1. Monitor function execution times in Firebase Console
# 2. Check for unnecessary function calls
# 3. Optimize database queries
# 4. Use appropriate memory limits
# 5. Enable cold starts (minInstances: 0)
