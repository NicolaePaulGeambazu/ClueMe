- **Preview Mode**: Let users try premium features for 1-3 uses
- **Success Stories**: Show how premium features solve real problems

#### 2. **Social Proof & FOMO**
- **Family Pressure**: "Your family member upgraded - join them!"
- **Usage Comparisons**: "Families like yours use 3x more features"
- **Community Features**: Premium-only family challenges and leaderboards
- **Limited Time Offers**: Seasonal promotions and early adopter benefits

#### 3. **Habit Formation**
- **Streak Tracking**: Show completion streaks that premium enhances
- **Progress Visualization**: Premium analytics show meaningful insights
- **Achievement System**: Gamification that premium amplifies
- **Personalization**: Premium features learn and adapt to user patterns

### Conversion Funnel Optimization
