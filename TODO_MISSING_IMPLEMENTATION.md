## 12. Calendar Functionality - Major Overhaul Required
- [x] **Fix Today's Reminders Display Issue** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Problem:** When no reminders today but 2 tomorrow, closing day view and going to month view shows reminders for today incorrectly
  - **Root Cause:** Date comparison logic in `getEventsForDate` and `getAllReminders` is inconsistent
  - **Files fixed:** `src/screens/calendar.tsx`, `src/utils/calendarUtils.ts` (new file)
  - **Solution:** Created new `calendarUtils.ts` with consistent timezone-aware date comparison functions
  - **Changes:**
    - Created `getAllCalendarEvents()` function for consistent event generation
    - Created `getEventsForDate()` function for proper date filtering
    - Created `createMarkedDates()` function for consistent calendar marking
    - Updated calendar screen to use new utilities
    - Fixed timezone handling and date comparison logic

- [x] **Recurring Reminders Calendar Display** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Problem:** Recurring reminders don't show future occurrences correctly in calendar
  - **Current Issues:** 
    - `generateRecurringOccurrences` has infinite loop potential (iterationCount < 100)
    - Doesn't respect `recurringEndDate` properly
    - Timezone handling is inconsistent
  - **Files fixed:** `src/screens/calendar.tsx`, `src/utils/calendarUtils.ts`
  - **Solution:** Rewrote recurring reminder generation with proper end date handling and timezone support
  - **Changes:**
    - Created `generateRecurringOccurrences()` function with proper end date handling
    - Added `maxOccurrences` parameter to prevent infinite loops
    - Added proper `recurringEndDate` checking
    - Fixed timezone handling in date calculations
    - Improved performance with better iteration control

- [x] **Calendar Data Consistency** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Problem:** Different date formats and timezone handling between home screen and calendar
  - **Issues:**
    - Home screen uses `getTodayISO()` for comparison
    - Calendar uses `new Date()` and string comparisons
    - Inconsistent date parsing between `getReminderDateString` and home screen logic
  - **Solution:** Created unified date handling utilities in `calendarUtils.ts`
  - **Changes:**
    - Created `parseCalendarDate()` function for consistent date parsing
    - Created `compareCalendarDates()` function for consistent date comparison
    - Created `isDateToday()`, `isDateInPast()`, `isDateInFuture()` functions
    - Unified date string format handling (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - Consistent timezone handling across all calendar functions

- [x] **Calendar Performance Optimization** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Problem:** Calendar re-renders excessively due to complex calculations in render
  - **Issues:**
    - `getAllReminders` recalculates on every render
    - `getMarkedDates` recalculates on every render
    - No memoization of expensive operations
  - **Solution:** Implemented proper memoization and optimized calculations
  - **Changes:**
    - Added `useMemo` for `allCalendarEvents` to prevent recalculation
    - Added `useMemo` for `markedDates` to prevent recalculation
    - Added `useMemo` for `selectedDateEvents` to prevent recalculation
    - Added `useMemo` for `timeBlocks` to prevent recalculation
    - Added `useMemo` for `calendarTheme` to prevent recreation
    - Added `useCallback` for all event handlers to prevent recreation
    - Optimized component re-renders with proper dependency arrays

- [ ] **Calendar UI/UX Improvements**
  - **Current Issues:**
    - Limited time range (6 AM to 10 PM only)
    - No all-day event support
    - No multi-day event support

## 13. Performance, Internationalization, Subscription, and Monetization Overhaul

### Performance & Firebase Read Optimization
- [ ] Batch Firestore reads using `where`, `in`, and `array-contains-any` queries where possible
- [ ] Implement local caching (IndexedDB/AsyncStorage) for reminders and family data
- [ ] Use selective Firestore listeners (subscribe only for active screens, unsubscribe on blur)
- [ ] Denormalize for home/calendar: maintain summary docs for today/this week's reminders (Cloud Functions update on write)
- [ ] Prefetch reminders for the next N days (e.g., 7) on app open, not the whole history
- [ ] Audit all screens/components for unnecessary Firestore reads and optimize

- [ ] Add `timezone` and `region` fields to user profile (auto-detect on sign-up, allow override)
- [ ] Ensure all date calculations (overdue, today, recurring) use user's timezone
- [ ] Audit and fix all DST (daylight saving) edge cases
- [ ] Use i18n for all user-facing text, including promo/pricing
- [ ] Support region-specific pricing and promotions
